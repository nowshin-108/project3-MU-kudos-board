### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yeah, the labs did prepare me. I felt unprepared while doing the user authentication stretech feature as they didn't teach it in class. But glad that it was dropped.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
Add more css, add downvote button on the cards and also like button for the comments

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Didn't present yet.
